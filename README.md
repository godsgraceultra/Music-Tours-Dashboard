## Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations
- **Power Query & DAX:** Calculations and metrics in Power BI
- **Google Slides & Docs:** Report presentation and storytelling

## Features
- Cleaned and formatted messy dataset
